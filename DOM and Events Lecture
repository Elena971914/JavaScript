DOM - document object module

What gives us the opportunity to work with the HTML. The browser creates the DOM(representnation of the HTML of a page). 
<script> tag can be added in the html file. If our JS is in another file: 
<script src="index.js"></script>
It is better to diverse responsibilities.
